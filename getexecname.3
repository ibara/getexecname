.Nd get pathname of running executable
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In getexecname.h
.Ft const char *
.Fn getexecname "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

.Xr getprogname 3
.Sh AUTHORS
.Nm
was written by
.An Brian Callahan Aq Mt bcallah@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
In the event that there are two or more binaries with identical names on
the system, it is possible that
.Nm
will return an incorrect pathname if using the fallback
.Sy PATH
environment variable-based resolution.
Starting the process from a shell with the
.Sy _
environment variable, such as
.Xr ksh 1
or
.Xr bash 1 ,
will help mitigate this issue.
